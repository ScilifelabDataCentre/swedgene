Swedish Reference Genome Portal
========

This repository contains the source code for the [Swedish Reference Genome Portal](https://genomes.scilifelab.se/), which:

- Showcases genome research performed in Sweden on non-model eukaryotic species.
- Lowers the barrier of entry to access, visualise, and interpret genome data.
- Encourages sharing of genomic annotations, even the seldom-published kind.
- Strives to present FAIR data, available in public repositories.

## Overview

- The Swedish Reference Genome Portal website is built using the
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static web generator.

-  The [JBrowse2](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/) genome browser is
embedded within the website to visually explore genome datasets.

- Primary data file sources are available in public repositories
(such as [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home)), and prepared
for display on JBrowse by our `Makefile` recipes (essentially
compressing and indexing).

- The code for the Genome Portal is available under an MIT (open
  source) license.

- The Genome Portal website is currently hosted by the [KTH Royal
  Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/) in Stockholm.

## Contributing

Two types of contributions are especially welcome:

- **Datasets for display in the portal**: Consult our
[requirements](https://genomes.scilifelab.se/contribute) for including a
genome dataset to the portal, and [contact us](#contact-us) if you have any questions. Download the [species submission form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/genome-portal/main/species_submission/submission_form_templates/01-species-submission_v1.3.docx) and the [data tracks form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/genome-portal/main/species_submission/submission_form_templates/02-data-tracks_v1.3.xlsx), fill them in, then either submit a new species by Pull Request, as described in [this guide](species_submission/how_to_submit_through_pull_request.md), or email the completed forms to us and we'll set up the data for you.

- **Source code and documentation**: We welcome contributions, small and large,
to our codebase and documentation. They will be published after review and
approval by the Genome Portal team. Fork, open a PR, or contact us to discuss ideas!

## Technical overview

This section contains high-level technical documentation about the
source code.

### Repository layout

- The `config/` directory contains information about data sources
  (tracks and assemblies) displayed in the genome browser.
  - Each species subdirectory includes:
	- `config.yml` : specifies the assembly and tracks to be displayed in JBrowse2.
	- `config.json` : starting point from which to generate a complete JBrowse2
      configuration, based on `config.yaml`. A common use is to define
      default browsing sessions.

- Different `make` recipes prepare the material described in `config/`
  for use by JBrowse2. The main operations are downloading data files,
  compressing using `bgzip` and indexing with `samtools`.

- The website content resides in the `hugo` directory.
  - Most importantly, each species gets:
    1. A content subdirectory in `hugo/content/species/` (e.g. `hugo/content/species/parnassius_apollo`).
	2. A data directory in `hugo/data/` (taxonomic information and statistics).
	3. An assets directory in `hugo/assets` (data inventory).

- The `scripts` folder contains executables to help:
    1. Build and serve the website using Docker.
	2. Add a new species to the website content.
	3. Add new datasets to the portal.

- The `tests` folder contains tests and fixtures, mainly covering the
  data preparation scripts.

- The `docker` folder contains two Docker files:
	1. `docker/data.dockerfile` used for data preparation (everything that `make` needs).
	2. `docker/hugo.dockerfile` used to build and serve the website.

### Local development

The steps described below requires
[`docker`](https://www.docker.com/) to be installed.

**1. Clone the repository**

```
git clone git@github.com:ScilifelabDataCentre/genome-portal.git
cd genome-portal
```

**2. Build and install the genomic data**

```bash
# Build local image from `docker/data.dockerfile`
./scripts/dockerbuild data

# Run the dockermake script to build the assets and install them locally.
./scripts/dockermake
```

You may need to be patient, some files are tens of Gigabytes. Should
only a subset of species be of interest, you can restrict the
scope of the build:

```bash
./scripts/dockermake SPECIES=parnassius_apollo,linum_tenue
```

**3. Run the web application container**

Then to run the website locally, you have several options:

#### i. Local development 

**This method is recommened for local development as it ensures local changes to both the Hugo content files and the data files are reflected in the browser immediately.** 
(Just refresh the page after making changes.)

```bash
# first command cleans up any prexisting containers
docker rm -f "genome-portal" "genome-portal-hugo"
./scripts/download_jbrowse hugo/static/browser  
./scripts/dockerserve -d
```


#### ii. Using the latest development image from GitHub Container Registry

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/scilifelabdatacentre/swg-hugo-site:dev
./scripts/dockerserve -t dev
```

#### iii. Using a local build (in non-development mode)

```bash
./scripts/dockerbuild -t local -k hugo
./scripts/dockerserve -t local
```

All of these methods will serve you the website at `http://localhost:8080/`.

### Making a new release/updating the dev cluster

We use [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to deploy and manage both the production and development instances of the genome portal.

This repository is responsible for making the 2 docker images needed for the deployment. This is controlled by this [GH actions workflow file](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/genome-portal/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish_images.yml).

**To update the production instance we need to create a new release with GitHub:**
- Identify a commit to base the release on.
- Agree with the team on the: 
  - commit to tag.
  - the planned version number (we use semantic versioning)
  - The contents of the release, [use the previous releases as inspiration](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/genome-portal/releases) 
- Once you have the go ahead, either:
  - Create an annotated tag locally (e.g: `git tag -a v1.3.1 "v1.3.1"` ) and push the tag, Then create the release (on that tag) using GitHub's interface.
  - Create the release using GitHub's interface and specify the commit you want to use and get GitHub to automatically create the tag for you.   
- Once the release is published, a GH actions workflow will be triggered automatically to build the two images. The docker images will be tagged with the same string as used for the git tag (i.e. vX.X.X). They will also be given the tag "latest". You can see [the docker images created from this repository here](https://github.com/orgs/ScilifelabDataCentre/packages?repo_name=genome-portal). 

- With the 2 images made, you can follow the instructions in the README of our [private repository that contains the kubernetes manifest files](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/argocd-genome-portal) which we use in combination with [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to define the desired state of the cluster. 

**To update the development instance** 

- Identify the commit you want the docker images to be built off of. 
- If the commit is on the main branch a GH actions workflow run will have already built the images ([unless the commit message was prefixed to skip CI](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/skipping-workflow-runs)). The images will be tagged with the full commit hash. If the image is already built your job on this repository is already done. 
- If the commit is on any other branch you'll need to trigger a [workflow_dispatch](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow) to create the docker images. 
- Head to the actions tag on GitHub and to the action "Build and push both docker images to the GitHub Container Registry". From there click run manual workflow. You can choose to specify the name of the image tag if you want. Otherwise leave the input blank and it will be tagged with the full commit hash.  


**Once the images are built you can head over to our [private repository that contains the kubernetes manifest files](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/argocd-genome-portal) and follow the instructions there on how to apply your changes to the cluster.**
