# Data organization

Each organism gets a sub-directory of `config/`, for example
`data/clupea_harengus`.

Each organism configuration directory includes a `config.yml` file
specifying the assembly and tracks to be displayed in JBrowse.

Different `make` recipes (documented below) use this information to
download and prepare genome files when necessary, and generate a
`config.json` configuration file used by JBrowse.

All those generated assets are then moved by `make install` to the
`hugo/static` directory, and thus made accessible to the development
server.

# Data operations

Primary sources for genomic assemblies and annotations tracks should
be hosted remotely. However, for some data formats such as `FASTA` and
`GFF`, JBrowse expects acompanying index files.

Therefore, remote `FASTA` and `GFF` files need to be downloaded for
indexing. We keep local copies of those files and ensure they are
compressed using the block gzip format.

# Up and running!

As a prerequisite to running the site locally, `docker` and `hugo` must be installed. 

To build and install JBrowse assets:

	# Build local docker image
	./scripts/dockerbuild.sh
	
	# Install JBrowse assets
	SWG_DOCKER_TAG=local ./scripts/dockermake.sh
	
	# Run local development server
    hugo server

## Selectively build JBrowse assets


To build JBrowse assests for a particular species:
	
	# Builds JBrowse assets for the herring only
	./scripts/dockermake.sh SPECIES=clupea_harengus build

# Docker 

This repository comes with 2 Dockerfiles:

### 1. `docker/hugo.dockerfile` : Builds a docker image containing the hugo website ready to be run. 
You can obtain the latest version of this image from the [packages section of this repository](https://github.com/orgs/ScilifelabDataCentre/packages?repo_name=swedgene). 

To build an run the Hugo site yourself/locally you can do the following from the root directory of the repository. 

_Please note that you need to be in the root of the repository for this to work_

```bash 
docker build -t hugo-site:local -f docker/hugo.dockerfile .
```

You can run then run this image locally as follows: 

```bash 
docker run -p 8080:8080 hugo-site:local
```

The site will be then visible to you at the address: http://localhost:8080/ on your web browser. 



### 2. `docker/data.dockerfile` : Builds a Docker image that can be used to download and process the data assets needed for the JBrowse section of the website. 

As above, you can obtain the latest version of this image from the [packages section of this repository](https://github.com/orgs/ScilifelabDataCentre/packages?repo_name=swedgene). 

Then to use the image to build all the data files you can use the provided script: 

```bash 
./scripts/dockermake.sh build
```

If you want to specfiy the image and/or tag used you can specify them via enviroment variables
For example:

```bash 
SWG_DOCKER_IMAGE=ghcr.io/scilifelabdatacentre/data-builder SWG_DOCKER_TAG=docker-dir ./scripts/dockermake.sh build
```




# pre-commit

This repository uses [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) which can be used to automatically test the changes made between each commit to check your code. Things like linting and bad formatting can be spott

### Setup pre-commit
##### Step 1

To setup `pre-commit` when commiting to this repo you'll need to install the python package `pre-commit`. You can do that using either:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
# OR
pip install pre-commit==3.7.0
```

##### Step 2

Then you'll need to install the precommit hooks (run from the root of the GitHub repository). 

```
pre-commit install
```

### Commiting with pre-commit installed: 

Now when you commit with pre-commit installed you're commits will be tested against the pre-commit hooks included in this branch and if everything goes well it will look something like this:

``` 
$ git commit 
Check Yaml...............................................................Passed
Check JSON...............................................................Passed
Check for added large files..............................................Passed
Fix End of Files.........................................................Passed
Trim Trailing Whitespace.................................................Passed
markdownlint-fix.........................................................Passed
ruff.....................................................................Passed
ruff-format..............................................................Passed
[add-precommit-ghactions 71c6541] Run: "pre-commit run --all-files"
 39 files changed, 59 insertions(+), 67 deletions(-)
```

If one of the tests failed your commit will be blocked If a check fails during the `pre-commit` process, the commit will be blocked and will not proceed. The `pre-commit` tool will output a message indicating which hook failed and often provide some information about what caused the failure. 

Pre-commit will fix most issues itself the developer is expected to fix the issues that caused the failure and then attempt the commit again. Once all hooks pass, the commit will be allowed to proceed.


Whilst not ideal, if you need to bypass the failing test, you could edit the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file or skip running pre-commit on this test. 

``` 
git commit --no-verify 
``` 

### pre-commit and GitHub actions
The pre-commit tests are also run using GitHub actions as a way to ensure the code commited passes the pre-commit tests (pre-commit is run locally on each developers PC). In some cases new rules/exceptions should be added to the pre-commit tests as they may be too strict we run so don't take it personally if your code fails a check.
